# ResponsivePortfolio

THIS IS THE UPDATED RESPONSIVIE PORTFOLIO!
- I updated the portfolio page
Unit 2 Homework Assignment

In this assignment, we were tasked to begin creating our personal websites. We were given reference screenshots as guides and were encouraged to achieve the following...
-Include a navbar
-Include Responsive Images
-Include a Responsive Layout

I was able to achieve all three initiative as well as the minimum requirements below...
Project Requirements 
(as listed on the actual assignment repository)	Assignment Accomplishments
-Functional, deployed application: Was able to launch site via GitHub – see link above
-README describing the project: Kept notes throughout the entire process
-Consistent navbar: Made sure that navbar is active on specific page that view is looking at
-All links must work: All links work
-Must use semantic HTML: Used articles, headers and other elements to keep all pages organized
-Valid & correct HTML: All elements work and are able to appear on the launch site
-Personalized information: Included personal pictures, bio and real links to personal platforms (LinkedIn and GitHub)
-Bootstrap components: Included multiple Bootstrap components: navbar, footer & card

I found this project to be creative and fun and challenging. I did have issues changing the colors and formatting the size of the cards on the portfolio page but I am making time with a tutor this week to help fix that. But I gave it my best try and I was happy to add the images and make sure all the links and alt texts work.

This is a work in progress, but I am content with how phase one has gone.
